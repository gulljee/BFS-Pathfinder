ðŸ§± Step-by-Step Plan
1. Grid & Maze Setup
Create a 2D grid using Pygame.

Make some walls (manual or random).

Choose start and end points.

2. DFS & BFS Algorithms
Represent the grid as a graph.

Each cell is a node.

Neighbors are up/down/left/right (if not wall).

3. Visualization
Color each cell as visited.

Color final path in different color.

Use pygame.time.wait(ms) for animation effect.

4. User Interface
Add buttons or keys to trigger DFS or BFS.

ðŸŽ¨ Color Scheme (Example)
White: Empty cell

Black: Wall

Green: Start

Red: End

Blue: Visiting cell

Yellow: Final path
